=head1 NAME

IPC::Simple - simple, non-blocking IPC

=head1 VERSION

version 0.03

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use IPC::Simple;

  my $ssh = IPC::Simple->new(
    cmd  => 'ssh',
    args => [ $host ],
    eol  => "\n",
  );

  if ($ssh->launch) {
    $ssh->send('ls -lah');          # get directory listing
    $ssh->send('echo');             # signal our loop that the listing is done

    while (my $msg = $ssh->recv) {  # echo's output will be an empty string
      if ($msg->error) {            # I/O error
        croak $msg;
      }
      elsif ($msg->stderr) {        # output to STDERR
        warn $msg;
      }
      elsif ($msg->stdout) {        # output to STDOUT
        say $msg;
      }
    }

    $ssh->send('exit');             # terminate the connection
    $ssh->join;                     # wait for the process to terminate
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides a simplified interface for managing and kibbitzing with a child
process.

=head1 METHODS

=head1 new

Creates a new C<IPC::Simple> process object. The process is not immediately
launched; see L</launch>.

=head2 constructor arguments

=over

=item cmd

The command to launch in a child process.

=item args

An array ref of arguments to C<cmd>.

=item eol

The end-of-line character to print at the end of each call to L</send>.
Defaults to C<"\n">.

=back

=head2 pid

Once launched, returns the pid of the child process.

=head2 exit_status

Once a child process exits, this is set to the exit status (C<$?>) of the child
process.

=head2 exit_code

Once a child process has terminated, this is set to the exit code of the child
process.

=head2 launch

Starts the child process. Returns true on success, croaks on failure to launch
the process.

=head2 terminate

Sends the child process a `SIGTERM`. Returns immediately. Use L</join> to wait
for the process to finish.

=head2 join

Blocks until the child process has exited.

=head2 send

Sends a string of text to the child process. The string will be appended with
the value of L</eol>.

=head2 recv

Waits for and returns the next line of output from the process, which may be
from C<STDOUT>, from C<STDERR>, or it could be an error message resulting from
an I/O error while communicating with the process (e.g. a C<SIGPIPE> or
abnormal termination).

Each message returned by C<recv> is an object overloaded so that it can be
treated as a string as well as providing the following methods:

=head2 async

Schedules a callback for the next line of input to be received, returning
immediately.

  $proc->async(sub{
    my $msg = shift;

    if ($msg->stdout) {
      ...
    }
  });

This is done with L<AnyEvent/CONDITION-VARIABLES>, so the same caveats about
races and dead locks apply. It is up to the caller to manage their event loop.

=over

=item stdout

True when the message came from the child process' C<STDOUT>.

=item stderr

True when the message came from the child process' C<STDERR>.

=item error

True when the message is a sub-process communication error.

=back

=head1 DEBUGGING

C<IPC::Simple> will emit highly verbose messages to C<STDERR> if the
environment variable C<IPC_SIMPLE_DEBUG> is set to a true value.

=head1 MSWIN32 SUPPORT

Nope.
