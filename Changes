- NOTE: there are backward incompatible changes to the API in this release
- Add importable convenience constructor spawn()
- Removes args constructor parameter; instead, cmd accepts either a complete
  command string or an array ref of the command and its arguments
- Removes IPC::Simple->async; it was unreliable and of dubious value
- Caller may request individual channels for stdout, stderr, and errors;
  messages for any that are not requested fallback to the combined channel
