package IPC::Simple::Group;
# ABSTRACT: work with several processes as a group

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The constructor for this class should be considered private, and the semantics
for instantiating this class may change.

Instead, use L<IPC::Simple/process_group> to create process groups.

Also note that processes being added to a group must fit the following criteria:

=over

=item no recv_cb

=item no term_cb

=back

Grouping processes that have already been launched may result in messages
being queued in the process' own queue rather than the group one.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 members

Returns the unordered list of L<IPC::Simple> processes within this group.

=head2 launch

Launches all of the processes in this group.

=head2 terminate

Terminates all of the processes in this group. Arguments are forwarded to
L<IPC::Simple/terminate>.

=head2 signal

Sends a signal to all members of the group. Arguments are forwarded to
L<IPC::Simple/signal>.

  $group->signal('HUP');

=head2 join

Blocks until all of the processes in this group have terminated.

=head2 recv

Returns the next message to be received from one of the processes in this group.
